  hello_world ascii "Hello, World!" # helloworld
section code # code section
entry start  # entry selection
start:       # start label
  mov 1, r0
  mov hello_world, r1  # write syscall -> write(r0 = 1, r1 = adress of hello_world, r2 = 14 (size));
  mov 14, r2
  syscall 1 # syscall and id (0 = read, 1 = write, references -> https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/)
