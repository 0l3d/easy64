# EASY64

Simple cpu architecture in C.

## Features

- Simple and fast CPU architecture
- Easy-to-understand assembly language
- Label handling and jump instructions
- Basic stack operations (push, pop, call, ret)
- Arithmetic, logic, and bitwise operations
- Input/output instructions (print, input)

# Planned

- Sections (data, bss)
- Entry point (for example: entry label)
- Sub Register Support (Assembler generates binaries for sub-registers like r0, e0, b0, p0; currently CPU does not support execution on these sub-registers)
